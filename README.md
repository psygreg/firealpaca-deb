# firealpaca-deb

Debian repacking of FireAlpaca's AppImage, because AppImages are just not that great.

## Usage

I made an installer script to fix .desktop files not showing up properly in the Applications menu after installing the .deb package.

- Download both `FireAlpaca.deb` and `installer.sh` from Releases.
- Open a Terminal in the folder you downloaded those files, then:\
`chmod +x installer.sh`\
`./installer.sh`
