# firealpaca-deb

Debian repacking of FireAlpaca's AppImage, because AppImages are just not that great.

## Usage

I made an installer script to fix .desktop files not showing up properly in the Applications menu after installing the .deb package.

### Without terminal
- Download `installer.sh` from latest [Release](https://github.com/psygreg/firealpaca-deb/releases).
- Right click the downloaded script, go to Properties from the submenu that appears and set it to run as a program.
- Double click.

### Using Terminal
`git clone https://github.com/psygreg/firealpaca-deb.git`\
`cd firealpaca-deb`\
`chmod +x installer.sh`\
`./installer.sh`
